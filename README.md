# Windows 10 IoT Control Center
This is an UWP app that will control simple IoT toys such as: 
* LED 
* RELAY
* FAN (Beta)
* TEMPERATURE SENSOR (Beta)
Just download and deploy the best Instruction (x64) if your Pi supported
And enjoy the UI. This will show the future of the Windows IoT OS is ready
to compete with other Raspberry OS. And high hope for dotnet to join the game.
